=====================

This is central repository for my WFMU Free Music Archive visualisations.

The <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org">Free Music Archive (FMA)</a> is project by the freeform radio station <a href="http://wfmu.org">WFMU</a>, which is based in Jersey City, New Jersey.

In line with WFMU's open access philosophy, the Free Music Archive provides a library of legal audio that anyone can download, and has a basic API that provides access to curator, album, artist and track data in JSON, JSONP and XML formats.
